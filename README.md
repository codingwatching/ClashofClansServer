## Supercell.Magic - Project
***Supercell.Magic*** is a Clash of Clans Server.
It was written by myself.
The goal of this server was to implement all the features of Clash of Clans and support millions of players.
Supercell.Magic uses dedicated threads and async operators. 
**Couchbase servers** & a **memory based** saving server will be used to save players.

## About us
I probably won't update the git. I don't have time with the studies to work on it anymore.
If you have any questions, you can contact me on discord (@Mimi8297#8726).
You can use it to create your own private server if you wish. The current version has some logic bugs.
Here is a site that uses this version: https://atrasis.net.
I offer partnerships that allow you to have your own private server. Prices are $350/month.
